			The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests conducted by the OECD in 2015 and 2018 showed that 	
			<mark>Indonesian students were performing at lower levels in all areas</mark> – science, mathematics and reading – than the OECD average.

		<p> Due to the poor quality of education in Indonesia, we make this website. We believe we can help Indonesian government to make a better education and better future for Indonesia through this website. We also believe we can help a lot of people from Indonesia and out there. With this platform people are able to find sources to study various subjects online- based with a lot of options to choose. With only one tap you will be connected to dozens e-learning websites, educational youtube channels and apps.
